# ðŸ›© UK Airline EDA and Classification Predictions
## Objectives
In this project, I (1) explored the data of a fictional UK airline to uncover insights about the potential drivers of passenger satisfaction and (2) built classification models to predict satisfaction. All processes are done using R.

## Data Pre-Processing
Before further analysis, the dataset has been examined based on data quality dimensions such as Accuracy, Completeness, and Timeliness (Berthold et al., 2010).

One dimension where issues are found is Completeness. Specifically, a total of 1522 missing values are present in multiple variables (Figure 1.1).

Since NAs in service evaluation variables might come from the lack of such service on the flight, these along with the NAs in â€˜Arrival Delayâ€™ are assumed to be missing at random, and thus, the observations with these values are removed from the dataset. On a related note, since the minimum age permitted to travel alone for some airlines is 14 (opodo.co.uk, 2019), feedback from these minors might be biased due to the possible influence of legal guardians accompanying them on the flight. Therefore, observations from passengers under 14 are also removed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Information Values
To investigate the importance level of each variable, IVs are used and supported by relevant conditional probability plots.

In Table 2.1, the IVs of â€˜Arrival Delayâ€™, Departure Delayâ€™, â€˜Time convenienceâ€™ and â€˜Genderâ€™ indicate weak discriminatory power. For Delay variables, the scatter plot in Figure 2.1 displays no separability of classes. This finding contrasts with common sense since delays typically impact passenger satisfaction negatively (Kim & Park, 2016), and so the relevance of this variable should still be considered. â€˜Time convenienceâ€™, however, does not appear to be important in predicting satisfaction perhaps because this has more to do with customersâ€™ initial flight-booking choice. Notably, Gender has the lowest IV, which suggests that this variable does not have discriminatory influence over satisfaction. Figure 2.2 supports this judgment as the portions of males and females given their satisfaction level are similar.

According to IVs, â€˜Gate location, â€˜Ageâ€™, â€˜Customer typeâ€™, â€˜Check-in serviceâ€™ and â€˜Food & drinkâ€™ have moderate predictive power over satisfaction. In Figure 2.3, even though it seems that older passengers tend to be more satisfied compared to younger passengers, the distinction between classes is not too pronounced. Moreover, individuals in similar age groups can still largely differ from each other, and so, it makes sense for â€˜Ageâ€™ to have low influence over satisfaction. For â€˜Gate locationâ€™, its low importance is also reasonable given how this is mostly outside of the airlineâ€™s control. In terms of â€˜Customer typeâ€™, the Weights of Evidence in Figure 2.4 specify that disloyal customers are less likely to be satisfied, while loyal customers are more likely to be satisfied compared to the whole population. The WoE also suggests that satisfaction is more easily predicted when a customer is categorised as â€˜disloyalâ€™. Regarding â€˜Check-in serviceâ€™ and â€˜Food & drinkâ€™ (Figure 2.5 and 2.6), it seems that people who are satisfied with these services are more likely to be satisfied overall and vice versa.

â€˜Ease of Online booking, â€˜Flight distanceâ€™, â€˜Inflight serviceâ€™, â€˜Baggage handlingâ€™, â€˜Cleanlinessâ€™, â€˜Onboard serviceâ€™, â€˜Leg room serviceâ€™ and â€˜Seat comfortâ€™ have relatively strong predictive power. From the figures below, it seems that if a customer is satisfied overall, there is greater chance that they will rate these airline aspects highly. Regarding â€˜Flight distanceâ€™, the scatter plot in the bottom panel of Figure 2.1 displays the separability of satisfied customers for longer distance flights.

â€˜Online boardingâ€™, â€˜Inflight WIFI serviceâ€™, â€˜Classâ€™, â€˜Type of travelâ€™ and â€˜Inflight entertainmentâ€™ have the strongest discriminatory power. Regarding â€˜Online boardingâ€™, it seems that if a person is satisfied overall, it is more probable that they have had a good experience with digital boarding. For â€˜Inflight entertainmentâ€™ and â€˜Inflight WIFI serviceâ€™, a similar pattern can also be seen in Figures 2.14 and 2.15. The high predictive power of these variables over passenger satisfaction is reasonable considering how online boarding helps customers save time, and digital services help people pass their time more enjoyably during the flight.

For â€˜Travel typeâ€™, the Weights of Evidence in Figure 2.16 suggest that, compared to the population, passengers who travel for business purposes are more likely to be satisfied, whereas those who travel for personal reasons tend to be either neutral or dissatisfied. In addition, the higher magnitude of WoE points out that satisfaction level is more predictable when the type of travel is â€˜Personalâ€™. A similar relation can also be seen in â€˜Classâ€™ (Figure 2.17). Since Business-class cabins have more premium benefits, it makes sense for Business passengers to be more likely to have higher overall enjoyment.
